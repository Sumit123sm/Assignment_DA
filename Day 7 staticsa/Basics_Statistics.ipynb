    "# 1. Explain the different types of data (qualitative and quantitative) and provide examples of each. Discuss nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.\n",
    "# Qualitative Data: Non-numerical data, e.g., colors, names, labels.\n",
    "# Quantitative Data: Numerical data, e.g., heights, weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples for each scale:\n",
    "# Nominal: Gender (Male/Female)\n",
    "# Ordinal: Education Level (High School, Bachelor's, Master's)\n",
    "# Interval: Temperature in Celsius\n",
    "# Ratio: Weight (0 means no weight, consistent ratios)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each? Discuss the mean, median, and mode with examples and situations where each is appropriate.\n",
    "# Mean: Average value, useful for symmetric data.\n",
    "# Median: Middle value, robust to outliers.\n",
    "# Mode: Most frequent value, useful for categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Data: [10, 20, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "# Mean = (10 + 20 + 20 + 30 + 40) / 5\n",
    "mean = sum([10, 20, 20, 30, 40]) / 5\n",
    "# Median = 20 (middle value after sorting)\n",
    "median = 20\n",
    "# Mode = 20 (most frequent value)\n",
    "mode = 20\n",

    "print(\"Median:\", median)\n",
    "print(\"Mode:\", mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Explain the concept of dispersion. How do variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data?\n",
    "# Dispersion indicates how spread out the data is. Variance measures the average squared deviations from the mean, while standard deviation is its square root, providing spread in the same units as the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Dataset: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "mean_data = sum(data) / len(data)\n",
    "variance = sum((x - mean_data) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)\n",
    "std_dev = variance ** 0.5\n",
    "print(\"Variance:\", variance)\n",
    "print(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. What is a box plot, and what can it tell you about the distribution of data?\n",
    "# A box plot visualizes the distribution of data using quartiles, median, and potential outliers. It shows spread, symmetry, and outliers.\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "plt.boxplot(data)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Box Plot of Data\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",

    "# 5. Discuss the role of random sampling in making inferences about populations.\n",
    "# Random sampling ensures each population member has an equal chance of selection, reducing bias and enabling generalization of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Explain the concept of skewness and its types. How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?\n",
    "# Skewness measures asymmetry of data. Positive skew (tail to the right), Negative skew (tail to the left), Zero skew (symmetric).\n",
    "# Skewness affects mean and median positioning: mean > median for positive skew.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?\n",
    "# IQR = Q3 - Q1, measures the middle 50% spread of data.\n",
    "# Outliers: Below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "data = np.array(data)\n",

    "# 8. Discuss the conditions under which the binomial distribution is used.\n",
    "# Used when:\n",
    "# - Fixed number of trials (n)\n",
    "# - Two outcomes (success/failure)\n",
    "# - Independent trials\n",
    "# - Constant probability of success (p)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. Explain the properties of the normal distribution and the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule).\n",
    "# Properties: Symmetrical, bell-shaped, mean = median = mode.\n",
    "# Empirical Rule: 68% within 1 SD, 95% within 2 SD, 99.7% within 3 SD.\n",
